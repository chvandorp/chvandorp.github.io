In this study, SHIV-infected macaques that are on ART are treated with a combination of the IL-15 superagonist N-803, and one or two broadly-neutralizing antibodies (10-1074 and 3BNC117). 
ART is then interrupted to see if these treatments can induce remission or control. Although the viral load (VL) rebounds in all scenarios, a large fracion of the treated animals is able to control the virus after this initial transient viral rebound, even below the limit of detection of 50 copies per mL. We first compare treatment groups with descriptive statistics (SPVL post rebound, AUC, peak VL), and then apply mathematical modeling to explain the difference between the treatment and control groups. These models are fit to panel data with Monolix.
