Prior to the first SARS-CoV-2 vaccination rollout in Protugal, it was not clear how quickly non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) could be lifted. Portugal had published plans what age groups and people at risk were going to be vaccinated in which time window. Using a model fit to seroprevalence and hospitalization data, we made predictions for the vaccination rollout period, incorporating the vaccination process in the model. 
We varied the amount of NPI implemented during this phase, to predict the number of hospitalizations under different scenarios. We advocated a step-wise relaxation approach to avoid future waves.
