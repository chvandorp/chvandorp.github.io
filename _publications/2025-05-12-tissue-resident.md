In this paper, we quantify how resident-memory CD4 T cells are maintained in the skin and gut lamina propria (LP) of mice, and what population they desent from. We did this with two fate reporter mouse models, and *of course* Bayesian ODE models implemented in Stan. In the fate reporter model, cells that express CD4 or Ki67 can be induced to express a fluorescent protein upon treatment with tamoxifen. The fluoresenct label is inherited by progentitors. This means that we can infer dynamics in system that is in equilibrium.
