In this paper, we estimate the strength of selection of a number of SARS-CoV-2 variants, taking differences between geographic regions into account. The first model is fit solely to mutant frequency data, and takes both migration and selection into account. The second model is a stochastic SEIHR model with two viral variants. This model is fit to both mutant 
frequencies and death incidence from a limited number of regions using sequential Monte Carlo, and serves mostly as validation of the first method.
