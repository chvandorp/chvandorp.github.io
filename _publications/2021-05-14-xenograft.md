CD8+ T cells play an important role in the control of HIV-1 infections, altough the precise mechanisms are not fully understood. These CD8+ T cells typically get an exhausted phenotype, limiting their cytotoxic and expansion capabilities. Immunotherapies aim to reverse this exhaustion, possibly leading to enhanced contol and ultimately induction of long-term remission. To test such therapies on an individual level, a humanized mouse model is explored. Collected data is longitudinal and contains viral load, CD8 and CD4 T cell counts, and viral genetic data. The genetic data reveals immune escape mutations that arise after authologous CD8 T cells are transferred to the mouse. We use ordinary differential equation modeling to estimate treatment effects, and measure the fitness cost of an escape mutation.
