We make use of multiple data stream of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) epidemiology in the Netherlands: hospitalization data, reported respiratory infection cases by general practitioners, and virological data.
We then fit age-structured ODE models to these timeseries for multiple seasons. Recovered individuals are assumed to be immune, but immunity wanes at an estimated rate between the seasons.
We then use the estimated model parameter to assess the effect of vaccination in different age groups.
