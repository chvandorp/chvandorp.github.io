After an influenza infection, T cells in the lung provide protection against future infection, but the concentration of such cells decays over time, leading to loss of immunity. These tissue-resident memory cells (TRM) are heterogeneous and not
well characterized. To infer dynamical parameters from a timeseries of single-cell flow cytometry data,
we develop a variational auto-encoder model that works for time-resolved data. The method can simultaneously clusters the data
and learns dynamical parameters like loss rates and differentiation rates.
