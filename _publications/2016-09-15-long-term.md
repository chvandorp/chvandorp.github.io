Influenza is known to be subject of "antigenic drift": a process in  which through random mutation the HA and NA proteins gradually change with time, leading to loss of immunity in the population, and recurring epidemics. Many T cell epitopes are less prone to mutation due to structural constrains (one might argue that NA and HA have evolved [to be evolvable](https://elifesciences.org/articles/03300)).
T-cell responses against influenza can prevent symptoms and reduce infectiousness, and might therefore be a target for immune escape as well. One complicating factor is HLA polymorphism, meaning that many individuals target different T-cell epitopes. To test if we can find a similar T-cell antigenic drift, we compiled a set of influenza sequences and T-cell responses from GISAID and IEDB. We found that the number of experimentally confirmed epitopes decreases with time, while confirmed non-epitopes are constant.
