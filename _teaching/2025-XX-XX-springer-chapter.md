Together with Dr. Ganna Rozhnova (Utrecht University), 
I am currently working on a chapter for the upcoming 
&quot;CIME Lecture Notes <i>Mathematical modeling 
for epidemiology: analysis, simulation and forecasting</i>&quot;

The chapter will be based on our work on SARS-CoV-2 modeling with Dutch and Portugese 
data. Topics will include age structured ODE models, Bayesian inference with Stan,
forecasting and counterfactual analyses.
