In Bayesian statistics, model comparison ideally is based on Bayes factors.
However, these are not always easy to compute. For this reason, 
approximate measures have been developed. One of these measures is the WBIC, which
has is similar to the BIC, but is not merely based on a point estimate and is valid for 
a larger class of models. In this post, I show how to compute WBIC with a Stan model.
