I wrote a blog post about how to contribute code to Stan.
This was quite a long process for a noob like me, resulting in a long blog post.
In this post, I will guide you through the process of implementing new native distributions
in Stan, writing documentation and tests, modifying the Stan compiler, and creating pull requests on GitHub.

It is hosted on my [tbz533 blog](https://tbz533.blogspot.com/2023/12/contributing-code-to-stan.html)
