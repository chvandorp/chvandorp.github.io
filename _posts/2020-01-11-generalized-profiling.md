This post is about implementing the generalized profiling method in Stan.
Fitting ODE models to timeseries data can be hard, especially if the data shows signs of 
process noise that cannot be simply absorbed into the measurement noise. A good example
is periodic dynamics, in which the phase drifts with time. The deterministic prediction
will in this case get out of phase with the stochastic data.

Even if the data is generated by a deterministic process (plus noisy measurments),
fitting an ODE model can be problematic because the likelihood landscale can be highly rugged. 
In both these scenarios, the *generalized profiling* method could be of use. In this post,
I show how this can be implemented in Stan, and fit a predator-pray model to pseudo data.
