I've been using <i>blogger</i> to write my blog posts for a while now.
I started a blog together with my colleague Sandro when we were working at the 
Theoretical Biology group at Utrecht University.
Our office was Z533, which is why we called our blog <a href="https://tbz533.blogspot.com">TBZ533</a>. 
I've listed some more popular or interesting posts from this blog below.


{% include base_path %}
{% capture written_year %}'None'{% endcapture %}
{% for post in site.posts %}
  {% capture year %}{{ post.date | date: '%Y' }}{% endcapture %}
  {% if year != written_year %}
    <h2 id="{{ year | slugify }}" class="archive__subtitle">{{ year }}</h2>
    {% capture written_year %}{{ year }}{% endcapture %}
  {% endif %}
  {% include archive-single.html %}
{% endfor %}
